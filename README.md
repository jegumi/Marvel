# Marvel

This is an experimental app to train myself with stuff related with architecture, designs features, tests, etc.

It uses the marvel api "http://developer.marvel.com/". To execute it you need to add your public and secret key to the marvel.properties file on the assets folder.

Next steps:

- Use RX Java, and remove deprecated Event Bus
- Add Dagger2 
- Add instrumental tests
